📘 MASTER RESEARCH & PROJECT PROMPT
Predictive Modeling and Risk Scoring for Bank Customer Churn
________________


🔷 PAGE 1 — Project Vision & Research Motivation
1.1 Research Background
This project focuses on building an intelligent system for early identification of customer churn in retail banking using machine learning techniques.
Customer churn directly affects:
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
* Revenue sustainability
* Customer loyalty
* Long-term competitiveness
Recent research emphasizes that predictive churn modeling combined with explainability enables banks to shift from reactive retention to proactive engagement strategies.
